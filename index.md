## About Me

My research is informed by and grows out of my dual training as both a social and behavioral health researcher (MSW in Macro Social Work with an emphasis on community health) and my doctoral training in cultural studies, specifically gender and sexuality studies. I siutuate my work squarely within feminist and queer cultural studies as well as the emerging sub-field of critical health studies. Broadly speaking, in my research I trace the histories of specific social and political moments in order to understand their impact and meaning today.
